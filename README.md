# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

A machine learning model that classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classic ML techniques. The model has been trained and tested using real-world news data from Kaggle, and can even be manually tested with your own headlines!

## ðŸš€ Project Features

- âœ… Preprocessed real & fake news data
- âœ… Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**
- âœ… Multiple ML models trained:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
- âœ… Built-in `manual_testing()` function for real-time testing
